## Data Analyst
Data analysts are responsible for collecting, processing and doing statistical analyses of data. They translate sales figures, market research, logistics, or transportation costs in plain English. They regulate, normalize, and calibrate the data so that it can be easily extracted and used.
The role of a data analyst is highly transferable and employment opportunities are available in both private and public sectors, including finance, consulting, manufacturing, pharmaceuticals, government and education.
## Concept Data

## Type of data variabel
### Category
Categorical data is data which is grouped into categories, such as data for a ‘gender’ or ‘smoking status’ variable. 
* Nominal
Nominal when the categories do not have an order, such as for a ‘marital status’ variable. Furthermore, if there are only two categories then the terms binary and/or dichotomous are sometimes used.

* Ordinal
Ordinal when the categories do have an order, such as for a ‘satisfaction level’ variable.
### Numeric
* Discrete
Discrete is a numerical type of data that includes whole, concrete numbers with specific and fixed data values determined by counting.
* Continues
includes complex numbers and varying data values measured over a particular time interval.

### Boolean
In general, a Boolean variable can have only two values - True or False. Or in other words, if a variable can have only these two values, we say that it's a 
Boolean variable.

## Data Structures
Structured data is the type of data that is well-organized and accurately formatted. This data exists in a format of relational databases (RDBMSs), meaning the information is stored in tables with rows and columns that are connected.

* Structure Data
stands for information that is highly organized, factual, and to-the-point. It usually comes in the form of letters and numbers that fit nicely into the rows and columns of tables.
* Unstructure Data
doesn't have any predefined structure to it and comes in all its diversity of forms. 

## Metadata
Metadata is defined as the data providing information about one or more aspects of the data; it is used to summarize basic information about data that can make tracking and working with specific data easier. Some examples include: Means of creation of the data.
