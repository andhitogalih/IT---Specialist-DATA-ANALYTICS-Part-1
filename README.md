Welcome to this Python learning repository!

This repository is designed to make learning Data Analist for students easy and enjoyable. Here, you'll find various learning materials, including:
* [Data Analytict]
* [Concept Data]
* [Type of data variabel]
* [DATA CLEANSING]
* [DATA MANIPULATION]

## Data Analyst
Data analysts are responsible for collecting, processing and doing statistical analyses of data. They translate sales figures, market research, logistics, or transportation costs in plain English. They regulate, normalize, and calibrate the data so that it can be easily extracted and used.
The role of a data analyst is highly transferable and employment opportunities are available in both private and public sectors, including finance, consulting, manufacturing, pharmaceuticals, government and education.
## Concept Data
Data is a collection of information gathered by observations, measurements, research or analysis. They may consist of facts, numbers, names, figures or even description of things. Data is organized in the form of graphs, charts or tables.

## Type of data variabel
### Category
Categorical data is data which is grouped into categories, such as data for a ‘gender’ or ‘smoking status’ variable. 
* Nominal
Nominal when the categories do not have an order, such as for a ‘marital status’ variable. Furthermore, if there are only two categories then the terms binary and/or dichotomous are sometimes used.

* Ordinal
Ordinal when the categories do have an order, such as for a ‘satisfaction level’ variable.
### Numeric
* Discrete
Discrete is a numerical type of data that includes whole, concrete numbers with specific and fixed data values determined by counting.
* Continues
includes complex numbers and varying data values measured over a particular time interval.

### Boolean
In general, a Boolean variable can have only two values - True or False. Or in other words, if a variable can have only these two values, we say that it's a 
Boolean variable.

## Data Structures
Structured data is the type of data that is well-organized and accurately formatted. This data exists in a format of relational databases (RDBMSs), meaning the information is stored in tables with rows and columns that are connected.

* Structure Data
stands for information that is highly organized, factual, and to-the-point. It usually comes in the form of letters and numbers that fit nicely into the rows and columns of tables.
* Unstructure Data
doesn't have any predefined structure to it and comes in all its diversity of forms. 

## Metadata
Metadata is defined as the data providing information about one or more aspects of the data; it is used to summarize basic information about data that can make tracking and working with specific data easier. Some examples include: Means of creation of the data.

## Current Data Situation (Big Data)
Big data refers to large, complex, and diverse collections of structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data that continue to grow exponentially over time. . 

Big data often exhibits three main characteristics known as the "3V": volume (large), velocity (fast), and variety (diverse). This means data that is large in volume, arrives at high speed, and comes in various types and formats.

## Data Cleansing
Data cleansing in Python refers to the process of identifying and correcting errors, inconsistencies, and inaccuracies in a dataset to improve its quality and reliability for analysis or other purposes. It involves various tasks such as handling missing values, removing duplicates, correcting inaccuracies, and standardizing formats.

### Handling Missing Data
Identifying and handling missing values in the dataset, either by removing them, imputing them with a suitable value, or using more advanced techniques like interpolation.

## Data Manipulation
Data manipulation refers to the process of transforming and restructuring data to make it suitable for analysis or visualization. Pivot tables are a common technique used in data manipulation, especially for summarizing and aggregating data in a structured format.
### Pivot
In Python, you can create pivot tables using various libraries, but one of the most commonly used ones is pandas. Pandas is a powerful data manipulation library that provides easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools.
### Grouping
In Python, you can use the groupby() method of pandas to perform a “group by” operation on your DataFrame. It allows you to group data based on specific values in one or more columns and then apply aggregation functions to each group.
### Crosstab
In Python, you can use the crosstab() function from the pandas library to create a crosstable, also known as a contingency table. This function calculates a simple cross table of two or more factors. This is very useful for analyzing categorical data and understanding the relationships between different variables.
### Dummies
Dummies or dummy variables are binary representations of a categorical variable in statistical analysis and machine learning. In Python, especially using the pandas library, you can create dummy variables easily using the get_dummies() function.
The result will be a new Data Frame with dummy variables for each unique value in a column. The dummy variable will have the value 1 if the sample has the appropriate value in the category, and 0 if not. Dummy variables help in introducing categorical variables into prediction models, especially in machine learning algorithms that require numerical input.
### Sort
Sorting data in Python refers to arranging the elements of a data structure, such as lists, arrays, or DataFrames, in a specified order. This order can be ascending (from smallest to largest) or descending (from largest to smallest), depending on needs.
### Rename
The rename function in Python, especially when used with pandas, is used to rename a column or index in a DataFrame.
### Concat
In Python, especially when working with pandas, the concat() function is used to combine two or more pandas objects along a specific axis (usually a row or column). This function is useful for combining data from several sources into one DataFrame.
### Merge
In Python, especially when working with pandas, the merge() function is used to combine two DataFrames by merging them based on one or more keys. This function is similar to SQL join operation.
